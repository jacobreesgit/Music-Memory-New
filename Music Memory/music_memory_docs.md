## Play Detection System

### Three-Tier Detection Strategy

Music Memory uses a sophisticated three-tier approach to ensure no plays are missed:

#### **1. Real-Time Tracking (Primary)**
**When**: App is active or backgrounded with audio permission
**How**: `PlaybackMonitor` class actively tracks playback

```swift
// Completion Criteria (Simplified)
- Single requirement: 50% of song duration must be played
- Must have valid song duration (> 0 seconds)
```

**Data Captured**:
- Exact playback duration
- Song completion percentage
- Precise timestamps
- Play source: `.realTime`

**Advantages**:
- Most accurate tracking
- Rich metadata available
- Immediate feedback
- Simple, consistent completion logic

#### **2. System Sync (Secondary)**
**When**: App reopens after being closed
**How**: `SystemSyncManager` compares current vs. last known system play counts

**Process**:
1. Query `MPMediaQuery` for all songs
2. Compare `item.playCount` with stored `lastSystemPlayCount`
3. Create `PlayEvent`s for newly discovered plays
4. Distribute timestamps across time since last sync

**Data Captured**:
- Play count differences
- Estimated timestamps
- Play source: `.systemSync`

**Advantages**:
- Captures background plays
- Never loses system-detected plays
- Automatic on app launch

#### **3. Historical Estimation (Tertiary)**
**When**: Initial library seeding
**How**: Creates estimated play events for existing system play counts

**Process**:
1. For each song with `playCount > 0`
2. Create historical `PlayEvent`s distributed over past year
3. Mark with play source: `.estimated`

**Advantages**:
- Preserves listening history
- Provides baseline for charts
- Smooth transition from system to app tracking

### Completion Criteria Deep Dive

#### **Simplified Approach**
Music Memory now uses a single, straightforward completion criterion:

**50% Rule**: A song is considered "played" when 50% of its total duration has been listened to.

#### **Implementation Logic**
```swift
func shouldCountAsPlay(totalTime: TimeInterval, songDuration: TimeInterval) -> Bool {
    // Must have valid song duration
    guard songDuration > 0 else { return false }
    
    // Must complete 50% of the song
    let completionPercentage = totalTime / songDuration
    return completionPercentage >= 0.5
}
```

#### **Real-World Examples**
| Song Length | Required Time | Reasoning |
|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| 30 seconds | 15 seconds | 50% of very short track |
| 2 minutes | 1 minute | 50% of standard pop song |
| 4 minutes | 2 minutes | 50% of standard rock song |
| 8 minutes | 4 minutes | 50% of long song |
| 15 minutes | 7.5 minutes | 50% of epic track |

#### **Benefits of 50% Only Rule**
1. **Consistency**: Same rule applies to all songs regardless of length
2. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand and implement
3. **Fairness**: Short songs aren't artificially inflated, long songs aren't capped
4. **Meaningful**: 50% represents genuine engagement with the music
5. **No Edge Cases**: No special handling for very short or very long tracks

## Data Models

### TrackedSong Model

```swift
@Model
final class TrackedSong {
    @Attribute(.unique) var persistentID: UInt64    // iOS system identifier
    var title: String                               // Song title
    var artist: String                              // Primary artist
    var albumTitle: String?                         // Album name (optional)
    var artworkFileName: String?                    // Local artwork file
    var duration: TimeInterval                      // Song length in seconds
    var lastSystemPlayCount: Int                    // Last known system count
    var lastSyncTimestamp: Date                     // When last synced
    var lastKnownRank: Int?                         // Current chart position
    var previousRank: Int?                          // Previous chart position
    
    @Relationship(deleteRule: .cascade, inverse: \PlayEvent.song)
    var playEvents: [PlayEvent] = []               // All play instances
    
    // Computed Properties
    var totalPlayCount: Int                        // All plays combined
    var realTimePlayCount: Int                     // Live-tracked plays only
    var systemSyncPlayCount: Int                   // Sync-discovered plays
    var estimatedPlayCount: Int                    // Historical estimates
    var rankMovement: RankMovement                 // Chart movement indicator
    var albumArtwork: UIImage?                     // Artwork from file system
}
```

### PlayEvent Model

```swift
@Model
final class PlayEvent {
    var timestamp: Date                            // When play occurred
    var song: TrackedSong?                         // Associated song
    var source: PlaySource                         // How play was detected
    var playbackDuration: TimeInterval?            // Actual time played
    var songDuration: TimeInterval?                // Total song length
    var completionPercentage: Double?              // % of song completed
}

enum PlaySource {
    case realTime      // Live tracking (highest reliability)
    case systemSync    // Discovered via sync (medium reliability)
    case estimated     // Historical estimate (lowest reliability)
}
```

### Data Relationships

```
TrackedSong (1) ←→ (Many) PlayEvent
     ↓
ArtworkManager → File System
     ↓
iOS MediaPlayer Framework
```

## Setup & Onboarding

### Setup Flow Overview

```
App Launch → Permission Check → Library Seeding → State Refresh → Main App (Tabs)
     ↓              ↓                ↓               ↓              ↓
 Check Stored   Request Music    Process Songs   Update Current   Charts & Settings
 Permissions    Library Access   + Artwork       Song State      Tabs Available
```

### Detailed Setup Process

#### **1. Permission Phase**
```swift
// Check current status
MPMediaLibrary.authorizationStatus()

// Request if needed
MPMediaLibrary.requestAuthorization { status in
    // Handle response
}
```

**States**:
- `.notDetermined` → Auto-request permission
- `.denied/.restricted` → Show settings guidance
- `.authorized` → Proceed to seeding

#### **2. Library Seeding Phase**
**Purpose**: Initial scan of entire music library

**Process**:
1. Query all songs: `MPMediaQuery.songs()`
2. For each song:
   - Create `TrackedSong` record
   - Extract and save artwork (300x300px JPEG)
   - Create historical `PlayEvent`s for existing play count
   - Update progress indicators

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Process in batches of 50 songs
- Save artwork with compression (80% quality)
- Background thread processing
- Progress updates every 10 songs

**Data Created**:
- `TrackedSong` records for all library songs
- Local artwork files in Documents/Artwork/
- Historical `PlayEvent`s with estimated timestamps
- UserDefaults flag: `hasSeededLibrary = true`

#### **3. State Refresh Phase**
**Purpose**: Ensure current song state is accurate after setup
**Process**:
1. Refresh current song from system music player
2. Update playback state (playing/paused)
3. Sync tracking state with current playback

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents blank now playing display after setup
- Ensures immediate tracking starts if music is playing
- Maintains consistency between system state and app state

#### **4. Transition to Main App**
**Trigger**: Seeding complete + permissions granted + state refreshed
**Animation**: Smooth fade transition with 0.5s duration
**Result**: User sees populated chart and current song in tab interface immediately

---

## Sync Strategies

### When Syncing Occurs

#### **1. App Launch Sync**
**Trigger**: Every app launch
**Type**: Full sync if >4 hours since last, otherwise quick sync
**Purpose**: Catch plays that occurred while app was closed
**Post-Action**: Refresh current song state

#### **2. Foreground Sync**
**Trigger**: App returns from background
**Type**: Quick sync (current song only)
**Purpose**: Update current song's play count
**Post-Action**: Refresh current song and playback state

#### **3. Manual Maintenance** (NEW)
**Trigger**: User taps "Database Maintenance" in Settings tab
**Type**: Cleanup operations only (not sync)
**Purpose**: User-initiated cleanup of old data

#### **4. Setup Completion Sync**
**Trigger**: Library seeding completion
**Type**: State refresh only
**Purpose**: Initialize current song tracking

### Sync Process Details

#### **Full Sync Process**
```swift
1. Query MPMediaQuery.songs() for all tracks
2. For each track:
   - Compare current playCount vs lastSystemPlayCount
   - If difference > 0:
     - Calculate new plays: current - last
     - Create PlayEvents distributed over time gap
     - Update lastSystemPlayCount and lastSyncTimestamp
3. Save all changes to SwiftData
4. Update UserDefaults: lastFullSyncDate
5. Refresh current song state
```

#### **Quick Sync Process**
```swift
1. Get current playing song only
2. Check if playCount increased
3. Create PlayEvents for new plays
4. Update song's sync timestamp
5. Refresh current song and playback state
```

#### **Timestamp Distribution Algorithm**
When multiple plays are discovered, they're distributed across the time gap:

```swift
// Example: 3 new plays discovered, last sync was 6 hours ago
let timeGap = 6 * 60 * 60 // 6 hours in seconds
let playsToCreate = 3

for i in 0..<playsToCreate {
    let randomOffset = TimeInterval.random(in: 0...timeGap)
    let playTime = lastSyncTime.addingTimeInterval(randomOffset)
    // Create PlayEvent with estimated timestamp
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Realistic distribution vs. clustering
- Maintains chronological order
- Supports time-based analytics

## Technical Implementation

### Tab Navigation Architecture

#### **MainTabView Structure**
```swift
struct MainTabView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ZStack(alignment: .bottom) {
            TabView {
                // Charts Tab
                NavigationView {
                    ChartView(tracker: tracker)
                }
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "chart.bar")
                    Text("Charts")
                }
                
                // Settings Tab
                NavigationView {
                    SettingsView()
                }
                .tabItem {
                    Image(systemName: "gear")
                    Text("Settings")
                }
            }
            
            // Overlaid Now Playing Bar
            NowPlayingBar(tracker: tracker)
                .padding(.bottom, 90)
        }
    }
}
```

### Completion Criteria Implementation

#### **Simplified PlaybackMonitor**
```swift
// Single completion criterion
private let minimumCompletionPercentage: Double = 0.5   // 50% of song

func shouldCountAsPlay(item: MPMediaItem) -> Bool {
    let songDuration = item.playbackDuration
    
    // Must have valid song duration
    guard songDuration > 0 else {
        print("⏭ Skipped - no song duration available")
        return false
    }
    
    // Must meet 50% completion requirement
    let completionPercentage = totalPlaybackTime / songDuration
    guard completionPercentage >= minimumCompletionPercentage else {
        print("⏭ Skipped - insufficient completion: \(Int(completionPercentage * 100))% < 50%")
        return false
    }
    
    return true
}
```

### Reset-to-Setup System

#### **Notification-Based Reset**
```swift
// Extension for custom notification
extension Notification.Name {
    static let resetToSetup = Notification.Name("resetToSetup")
}

// In main app - listening for reset
.onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: .resetToSetup)) { _ in
    resetToSetup()
}

// In settings - triggering reset
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .resetToSetup, object: nil)
```

#### **Reset Process**
1. User confirms data deletion in Settings
2. All TrackedSong records deleted (cascades to PlayEvents)
3. All artwork files removed from storage
4. UserDefaults cleared (setup flags, sync timestamps)
5. Notification posted to trigger app state change
6. App returns to setup flow automatically

### Database Management Operations

#### **Maintenance Operation**
```swift
func performMaintenance() async {
    // 1. Clean up old play events (>1 year)
    await cleanupOldPlayEvents()
    
    // 2. Remove unused album artwork files
    await cleanupUnusedArtwork()
    
    // 3. Delete songs with no plays (>6 months inactive)
    await cleanupUnusedSongs()
}
```

#### **Complete Data Deletion**
```swift
func deleteAllData() async {
    // 1. Delete all TrackedSong records (cascade deletes PlayEvents)
    let songs = try modelContext.fetch(FetchDescriptor<TrackedSong>())
    for song in songs {
        // Clean up associated artwork file
        if let fileName = song.artworkFileName {
            ArtworkManager.shared.deleteArtwork(for: fileName)
        }
        modelContext.delete(song)
    }
    
    // 2. Save database changes
    try modelContext.save()
    
    // 3. Clear app configuration
    UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "hasSeededLibrary")
    UserDefaults.standard.removeObject(forKey: "lastFullSyncDate")
    
    // 4. Trigger app reset to setup mode
    NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .resetToSetup, object: nil)
}
```

### State Management and Refresh

#### **Current Song State Refresh**
```swift
// NowPlayingTracker refresh methods
func refreshCurrentState() {
    updateCurrentSong()
    updatePlaybackState()
}

private func updateCurrentSong() {
    // Query current playing item from system
    // Match with tracked song in database
    // Update published currentSong property
}

private func updatePlaybackState() {
    // Check system playback state
    // Update published isPlaying property
}
```

**When Refresh Occurs**:
- App setup completion
- App foreground transition
- After sync operations
- After data operations
- Tab switches (automatic via environment)

## Conclusion

Music Memory now features a professional tab-based interface with simplified, consistent play detection criteria. The app uses a single 50% completion rule that applies universally to all songs, eliminating complexity while maintaining meaningful engagement tracking.

The app's evolution includes:

**Simplified Completion Logic**: The new 50% rule provides consistency across all song lengths, removing arbitrary time limits and special cases. This makes the system more predictable and fair for all types of music.

**User Interface**: Clean tab separation allows users to focus on music charts while having easy access to management tools. The overlaid Now Playing Bar maintains consistency across tabs without cluttering the interface.

**Data Management**: Comprehensive database management through user-friendly settings, with clear descriptions that explain technical operations in accessible terms. Complete data reset capability allows users to start fresh without app reinstallation.

**Safety and Control**: Multiple confirmation dialogs prevent accidental data loss, while detailed descriptions help users understand exactly what each operation does before proceeding.

**Technical Architecture**: Notification-based reset system ensures clean state transitions, while the tab structure provides a scalable foundation for future feature additions.

The simplified 50% completion criterion ensures that:
- **Short songs** (30 seconds) require meaningful engagement (15 seconds)
- **Standard songs** (3-4 minutes) follow familiar patterns (1.5-2 minutes)
- **Long songs** (10+ minutes) don't get artificial advantages (5+ minutes required)
- **Epic tracks** (20+ minutes) are treated fairly without caps (10+ minutes required)

This approach provides several key benefits:

**Consistency**: Every song follows the same completion rule, regardless of genre, era, or length. Users can predict exactly what constitutes a "play" for any track in their library.

**Fairness**: No genre bias - classical movements, metal epics, pop singles, and podcast-style tracks all compete on equal terms based on actual engagement percentage.

**Simplicity**: Developers and users alike benefit from a single, easy-to-understand rule that eliminates edge cases and special handling.

**Meaningful Metrics**: 50% completion represents genuine listening engagement while being achievable for most listening scenarios.

**Future-Proof**: As music consumption patterns evolve (shorter viral clips, longer ambient pieces), the percentage-based approach adapts automatically.

The three-tier play detection system continues to provide comprehensive music tracking, while the new interface makes the app more approachable for users who want powerful analytics without technical complexity.

Music Memory successfully balances sophisticated tracking capabilities with intuitive user control, making personal music analytics accessible to everyone while maintaining the technical depth needed for accurate, meaningful insights.

**System Requirements**:
- iOS 18.4 or later
- Music library access permission
- Active Apple Music or iTunes library
- SwiftData compatible device

**Privacy**:
- All data stored locally on device
- No external data transmission
- User controls all data retention and deletion
- Complete data portability through settings

**Performance**:
- Efficient real-time tracking with minimal battery impact
- Optimized artwork storage and management
- Background sync capabilities
- Scalable to libraries of 50,000+ songs

Music Memory represents a mature approach to personal music analytics, providing users with meaningful insights into their listening habits while respecting their privacy and giving them complete control over their data.
